# Titanic_Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset to uncover insights and patterns related to passenger survival. The dataset includes information such as age, gender, class, and fare, which were used to explore relationships and trends.

# Key Steps:

## Data Loading & Exploration:

Loaded the dataset using Pandas.

Explored the structure, columns, and basic statistics of the data.

## Handling Missing Values:

Identified and addressed missing values in columns like age, embarked, and deck.

Used techniques like imputation and dropping rows/columns where necessary.

## Outlier Detection with Z-Score:

Applied Z-Score to detect and handle outliers in numerical columns like age and fare.

Removed or adjusted outliers to ensure accurate analysis.

# Data Analysis:

Analyzed survival rates based on gender, class, and age.

Explored relationships between variables using correlation matrices.

# Data Visualization:

Created visualizations (histograms, bar plots, scatter plots) using Matplotlib and Seaborn to better understand the data.

Highlighted key insights such as the impact of class and gender on survival.

# Tools & Libraries Used:

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scipy (for Z-Score)
